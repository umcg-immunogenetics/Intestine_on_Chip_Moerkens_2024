Intestine_on_chip_media: Intestinal cells were exposed to different media conditions: expansion medium (EM), differentiation medium (DM), and EM on the basolateral and DM on the apical side of the intestinal barrier (EM-DM). 
Intestine_on_chip_IFN: Intestinal cells were exposed the EM-DM media condition and stimulated with interferon-beta or interferon-gamma.
